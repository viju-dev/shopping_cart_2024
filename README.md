## usage :
- Download this repository as zip by clicking on green button(<> code) which is located above the repository.
- Extract the zip by using any extractor like  [`7zip`](https://www.7-zip.org/).
- In repo there are two folders as you can see `JavaScript` and `Java` after extracting zip file you'll get same.
- To use `Java` one solution there will be some pre-requisities :
  - installed `Java` on your system.
  - code editor to edit run and check program.
  - you can install [`IntelliJ`](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) as its `Java IDE` comes with Jetbrains runtime bundled with `IDE` (based on `JRE 17`) [more details](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/installation-guide.html#requirements)
  - then just open main folder named as **shoppingCart** in `IDE` and run the program.
  - it will ask for inputs in terminal 2 times in a program provide valid inputs and after that it will give you result in the format asked in doc.
- To use `JavaScript` one solution there will be some pre-requisities :
  -  you required to have `Node.js` installed on your machine for [more details](https://nodejs.org/en)
  -  you can choose code editor for this like `VsCode` as its ease to use also it supports for lots of extensions.
  -  then open main folder named as **shopping-cart** in `Code editor`.
  -  then run command `npm install` it will install require packages like `prompt-async` that we have used in our program for taking inputs.
  -  then run command `node index.js` to run the program.
  -  it will ask for all inputs in terminal at 1st time only so provide valid inputs and after that it will give you result in the format asked in doc.
  -  for ease you can run `JavaScript` solution on online compiler just by removing first line from `index.js`  i.e.  `const prompt = require("prompt-sync")();`.
  -  for that you can prefer [`compiler`](https://www.programiz.com/javascript/online-compiler/) paste whole code from index.js inside this except first line mentioned above and run.
  -  **Note :**  for product quantity entering empty input will result `0` quantity whereas in gift-wrapping entering empty input will result `yes`.
 
### That's it, now you can modify code or give different inputs to check/verify the results.
